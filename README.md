A code demo wherein you get to describe/name a burger/food of your choice, and then log the fact that you have fake-consumed it. What? It's fun!

- and ~~a home-brewed ORM~~ Sequelize.


### How does it work?
- User submits name of burger/food, which then appears on left side of page.
- Burger/foods in this waiting area have a "devour it" option. Go ahead. Devour it.
- Devoured items appear in a list to the right.
- All food items, once created, are stored in a MySQL database for later reference.
